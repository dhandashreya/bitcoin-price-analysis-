# Bitcoin Price Analysis and Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes historical Bitcoin price data using Python.  
The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), time-series analysis, and forecasting, and later build an interactive dashboard.

This project is being developed alongside learning to ensure hands-on, practical understanding of data analysis workflows.

## 📊 Data Source
- **Dataset:** Bitcoin Historical Data (Kaggle)
- **Author:** mczielinski  
- **Kaggle Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data

The dataset provides daily Bitcoin prices including Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Market Capitalization.

## 🏗️ Data Generation Methodology
The original dataset was generated using a data pipeline maintained by the dataset author.  
The pipeline fetches raw Bitcoin data from public sources, cleans it, aggregates it into daily OHLC format, and publishes it to Kaggle.

- **Pipeline Repository:** https://github.com/mczielinski/kaggle-bitcoin

This project uses the published dataset and does not modify the original data generation process.
