# Bitcoin Price Analysis and Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes historical Bitcoin price data using Python.  
The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), time-series analysis, and forecasting, and later build an interactive dashboard.

This project is being developed alongside learning to ensure hands-on, practical understanding of data analysis workflows.

## 📊 Data Source
- **Dataset:** Bitcoin Historical Data (Kaggle)
- **Kaggle Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data

The dataset provides daily Bitcoin prices including Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Market Capitalization.

## 🏗️ Data Generation Methodology
The original dataset was generated using a data pipeline maintained by the dataset author.  
The pipeline fetches raw Bitcoin data from public sources, cleans it, aggregates it into daily OHLC format, and publishes it to Kaggle.

- **Pipeline Repository:** https://github.com/mczielinski/kaggle-bitcoin

This project uses the published dataset and does not modify the original data generation process.

## 📁 Project Structure
This repository is organized to follow a clear data analysis workflow:

- `data/` – raw and processed datasets  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling  
- `dashboard/` – dashboard files (Power BI)  
- `src/` – reusable helper functions (to be added later)
